<i>February</i> 25, 1890.</p>
<p>Sir,&mdash;It may probably occur to you that we have met, and 
visited, and conversed; on my side, with interest.&nbsp; You may 
remember that you have done me several courtesies, for which I 
was prepared to be grateful.&nbsp; But there are duties which 
come before gratitude, and offences which justly divide friends, 
far more acquaintances.&nbsp; Your letter to the Reverend H. B. 
Gage is a document which, in my sight, if you had filled me with 
bread when I was starving, if you had sat up to nurse my father 
when he lay a-dying, would yet absolve me from the bonds of 
gratitude.&nbsp; You know enough, doubtless, of the process of 
canonisation to be aware that, a hundred years after the death of
Damien, there will appear a man charged with the painful office 
of the <i>devil&rsquo;s advocate</i>.&nbsp; After that noble 
brother of mine, and of all frail clay, shall have lain a century
at rest, one shall accuse, one defend him.&nbsp; The circumstance
is unusual that the devil&rsquo;s advocate should be a volunteer,
should be a member of a sect immediately rival, and should make 
haste to take upon himself his ugly office ere the bones are 
cold; unusual, and of a taste which I shall leave my readers free
to qualify; unusual, and to me inspiring.&nbsp; If I have at all 
learned the trade of using words to convey truth and to arouse 
emotion, you have at last furnished me with a subject.&nbsp; For 
it is in the interest of all mankind, and the cause of public 
decency in every quarter of the world, not only that Damien 
should be righted, but that you and your letter should be 
displayed at length, in their true colours, to the public 
eye.</p>
<p>To do this properly, I must begin by quoting you at large: I 
shall then proceed to criticise your utterance from several 
points of view, divine and human, in the course of which I shall 
attempt to draw again, and with more specification, the character
of the dead saint whom it has pleased you to vilify: so much 
being done, I shall say farewell to you for ever.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span

&ldquo;<i>August</i> 2, 1889.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rev. H. B. GAGE.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Brother,&mdash;In answer to your inquires about 
Father Damien, I can only reply that we who knew the man are 
surprised at the extravagant newspaper laudations, as if he was a
most saintly philanthropist.&nbsp; The simple truth is, he was a 
coarse, dirty man, headstrong and bigoted.&nbsp; He was not sent 
to Molokai, but went there without orders; did not stay at the 
leper settlement (before he became one himself), but circulated 
freely over the whole island (less than half the island is 
devoted to the lepers), and he came often to Honolulu.&nbsp; He 
had no hand in the reforms and improvements inaugurated, which 
were the work of our Board of Health, as occasion required and 
means were provided.&nbsp; He was not a pure man in his relations
with women, and the leprosy of which he died should be attributed
to his vices and carelessness.&nbsp; Other have done much for the
lepers, our own ministers, the government physicians, and so 
forth, but never with the Catholic idea of meriting eternal 
life.&mdash;Yours, etc.,</p>

</blockquote>
<p>To deal fitly with a letter so extraordinary, I must draw at 
the outset on my private knowledge of the signatory and his 
sect.&nbsp; It may offend others; scarcely you, who have been so 
busy to collect, so bold to publish, gossip on your rivals.&nbsp;
And this is perhaps the moment when I may best explain to you the
character of what you are to read: I conceive you as a man quite 
beyond and below the reticences of civility: with what measure 
you mete, with that shall it be measured you again; with you, at 
last, I rejoice to feel the button off the foil and to plunge 
home.&nbsp; And if in aught that I shall say I should offend 
others, your colleagues, whom I respect and remember with 
affection, I can but offer them my regret; I am not free, I am 
inspired by the consideration of interests far more large; and 
such pain as can be inflicted by anything from me must be indeed 
trifling when compared with the pain with which they read your 
letter.&nbsp; It is not the hangman, but the criminal, that 
brings dishonour on the house.</p>
<p>You belong, sir, to a sect&mdash;I believe my sect, and that 
in which my ancestors laboured&mdash;which has enjoyed, and 
partly failed to utilise, and exceptional advantage in the 
islands of Hawaii.&nbsp; The first missionaries came; they found 
the land already self-purged of its old and bloody faith; they 
were embraced, almost on their arrival, with enthusiasm; what 
troubles they supported came far more from whites than from 
Hawaiians; and to these last they stood (in a rough figure) in 
the shoes of God.&nbsp; This is not the place to enter into the 
degree or causes of their failure, such as it is.&nbsp; One 
element alone is pertinent, and must here be plainly dealt 
with.&nbsp; In the course of their evangelical calling, 
they&mdash;or too many of them&mdash;grew rich.&nbsp; It may be 
news to you that the houses of missionaries are a cause of 
mocking on the streets of Honolulu.&nbsp; It will at least be 
news to you, that when I returned your civil visit, the driver of
my cab commented on the size, the taste, and the comfort of your 
home.&nbsp; It would have been news certainly to myself, had any 
one told me that afternoon that I should live to drag such a 
matter into print.&nbsp; But you see, sir, how you degrade better
men to your own level; and it is needful that those who are to 
judge betwixt you and me, betwixt Damien and the devil&rsquo;s 
advocate, should understand your letter to have been penned in a 
house which could raise, and that very justly, the envy and the 
comments of the passers-by.&nbsp; I think (to employ a phrase of 
yours which I admire) it &ldquo;should be attributed&rdquo; to 
you that you have never visited the scene of Damien&rsquo;s life 
and death.&nbsp; If you had, and had recalled it, and looked 
about your pleasant rooms, even your pen perhaps would have been 
stayed.</p>
<p>Your sect (and remember, as far as any sect avows me, it is 
mine) has not done ill in a worldly sense in the Hawaiian 
Kingdom.&nbsp; When calamity befell their innocent parishioners, 
when leprosy descended and took root in the Eight Islands, a 
<i>quid pro quo</i> was to be looked for.&nbsp; To that 
prosperous mission, and to you, as one of its adornments, God had
sent at last an opportunity.&nbsp; I know I am touching here upon
a nerve acutely sensitive.&nbsp; I know that others of your 
colleagues look back on the inertia of your Church, and the 
intrusive and decisive heroism of Damien, with something almost 
to be called remorse.&nbsp; I am sure it is so with yourself; I 
am persuaded your letter was inspired by a certain envy, not 
essentially ignoble, and the one human trait to be espied in that
performance.&nbsp; You were thinking of the lost chance, the past
day; of that which should have been conceived and was not; of the
service due and not rendered.&nbsp; <i>Time was</i>, said the 
voice in your ear, in your pleasant room, as you sat raging and 
writing; and if the words written were base beyond parallel, the 
rage, I am happy to repeat&mdash;it is the only compliment I 
shall pay you&mdash;the rage was almost virtuous.&nbsp; But, sir,
when we have failed, and another has succeeded; when we have 
stood by, and another has stepped in; when we sit and grow bulky 
in our charming mansions, and a plain, uncouth peasant steps into
the battle, under the eyes of God, and succours the afflicted, 
and consoles the dying, and is himself afflicted in his turn, and
dies upon the field of honour&mdash;the battle cannot be 
retrieved as your unhappy irritation has suggested.&nbsp; It is a
lost battle, and lost for ever.&nbsp; One thing remained to you 
in your defeat&mdash;some rags of common honour; and these you 
have made haste to cast away.</p>
<p>Common honour; not the honour of having done anything right, 
but the honour of not having done aught conspicuously foul; the 
honour of the inert: that was what remained to you.&nbsp; We are 
not all expected to be Damiens; a man may conceive his duty more 
narrowly, he may love his comforts better; and none will cast a 
stone at him for that.&nbsp; But will a gentleman of your 
reverend profession allow me an example from the fields of 
gallantry?&nbsp; When two gentlemen compete for the favour of a 
lady, and the one succeeds and the other is rejected, and (as 
will sometimes happen) matter damaging to the successful 
rival&rsquo;s credit reaches the ear of the defeated, it is held 
by plain men of no pretensions that his mouth is, in the 
circumstance, almost necessarily closed.&nbsp; Your Church and 
Damien&rsquo;s were in Hawaii upon a rivalry to do well: to help,
to edify, to set divine examples.&nbsp; You having (in one huge 
instance) failed, and Damien succeeded, I marvel it should not 
have occurred to you that you were doomed to silence; that when 
you had been outstripped in that high rivalry, and sat inglorious
in the midst of your well-being, in your pleasant room&mdash;and 
Damien, crowned with glories and horrors, toiled and rotted in 
that pigsty of his under the cliffs of Kalawao&mdash;you, the 
elect who would not, were the last man on earth to collect and 
propagate gossip on the volunteer who would and did.</p>
<p>I think I see you&mdash;for I try to see you in the flesh as I
write these sentences&mdash;I think I see you leap at the word 
pigsty, a hyperbolical expression at the best.&nbsp; &ldquo;He 
had no hand in the reforms,&rdquo; he was &ldquo;a coarse, dirty 
man&rdquo;; these were your own words; and you may think it 
possible that I am come to support you with fresh evidence.&nbsp;
In a sense, it is even so.&nbsp; Damien has been too much 
depicted with a conventional halo and conventional features; so 
drawn by men who perhaps had not the eye to remark or the pen to 
express the individual; or who perhaps were only blinded and 
silenced by generous admiration, such as I partly envy for 
myself&mdash;such as you, if your soul were enlightened, would 
envy on your bended knees.&nbsp; It is the least defect of such a
method of portraiture that it makes the path easy for the 
devil&rsquo;s advocate, and leaves the misuse of the slanderer a 
considerable field of truth.&nbsp; For the truth that is 
suppressed by friends is the readiest weapon of the enemy.&nbsp; 
The world, in your despite, may perhaps owe you something, if 
your letter be the means of substituting once for all a credible 
likeness for a wax abstraction.&nbsp; For, if that world at all 
remember you, on the day when Damien of Molokai shall be named a 
Saint, it will be in virtue of one work: your letter to the 
Reverend H. B. Gage.</p>
<p>You may ask on what authority I speak.&nbsp; It was my 
inclement destiny to become acquainted, not with Damien, but with
Dr. Hyde.&nbsp; When I visited the lazaretto, Damien was already 
in his resting grave.&nbsp; But such information as I have, I 
gathered on the spot in conversation with those who knew him well
and long: some indeed who revered his memory; but others who had 
sparred and wrangled with him, who beheld him with no halo, who 
perhaps regarded him with small respect, and through whose 
unprepared and scarcely partial communications the plain, human 
features of the man shone on me convincingly.&nbsp; These gave me
what knowledge I possess; and I learnt it in that scene where it 
could be most completely and sensitively 
understood&mdash;Kalawao, which you have never visited, about 
which you have never so much as endeavoured to inform yourself; 
for, brief as your letter is, you have found the means to stumble
into that confession.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Less than one-half</i> of 
the island,&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;is devoted to the 
lepers.&rdquo;&nbsp; Molokai&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Molokai 
ahina</i>,&rdquo; the &ldquo;grey,&rdquo; lofty, and most 
desolate island&mdash;along all its northern side plunges a front
of precipice into a sea of unusual profundity.&nbsp; This range 
of cliff is, from east to west, the true end and frontier of the 
island.&nbsp; Only in one spot there projects into the ocean a 
certain triangular and rugged down, grassy, stony, windy, and 
rising in the midst into a hill with a dead crater: the whole 
bearing to the cliff that overhangs it somewhat the same relation
as a bracket to a wall.&nbsp; With this hint you will now be able
to pick out the leper station on a map; you will be able to judge
how much of Molokai is thus cut off between the surf and 
precipice, whether less than a half, or less than a quarter, or a
fifth, or a tenth&mdash;or, say a twentieth; and the next time 
you burst into print you will be in a position to share with us 
the issue of your calculations.</p>
<p>I imagine you to be one of those persons who talk with 
cheerfulness of that place which oxen and wain-ropes could not 
drag you to behold.&nbsp; You, who do not even know its situation
on the map, probably denounce sensational descriptions, 
stretching your limbs the while in your pleasant parlour on 
Beretania Street.&nbsp; When I was pulled ashore there one early 
morning, there sat with me in the boat two sisters, bidding 
farewell (in humble imitation of Damien) to the lights and joys 
of human life.&nbsp; One of these wept silently; I could not 
withhold myself from joining her.&nbsp; Had you been there, it is
my belief that nature would have triumphed even in you; and as 
the boat drew but a little nearer, and you beheld the stairs 
crowded with abominable deformations of our common manhood, and 
saw yourself landing in the midst of such a population as only 
now and then surrounds us in the horror of a nightmare&mdash;what
a haggard eye you would have rolled over your reluctant shoulder 
towards the house on Beretania Street!&nbsp; Had you gone on; had
you found every fourth face a blot upon the landscape; had you 
visited the hospital and seen the butt-ends of human beings lying
there almost unrecognisable, but still breathing, still thinking,
still remembering; you would have understood that life in the 
lazaretto is an ordeal from which the nerves of a man&rsquo;s 
spirit shrink, even as his eye quails under the brightness of the
sun; you would have felt it was (even today) a pitiful place to 
visit and a hell to dwell in.&nbsp; It is not the fear of 
possible infection.&nbsp; That seems a little thing when compared
with the pain, the pity, and the disgust of the visitor&rsquo;s 
surroundings, and the atmosphere of affliction, disease, and 
physical disgrace in which he breathes.&nbsp; I do not think I am
a man more than usually timid; but I never recall the days and 
nights I spent upon that island promontory (eight days and seven 
nights), without heartfelt thankfulness that I am somewhere 
else.&nbsp; I find in my diary that I speak of my stay as a 
&ldquo;grinding experience&rdquo;: I have once jotted in the 
margin, &ldquo;<i>Harrowing</i> is the word&rdquo;; and when the 
<i>Mokolii</i> bore me at last towards the outer world, I kept 
repeating to myself, with a new conception of their pregnancy, 
those simple words of the song&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the most distressful country 
that ever yet was seen.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And observe: that which I saw and suffered from was a 
settlement purged, bettered, beautified; the new village built, 
the hospital and the Bishop-Home excellently arranged; the 
sisters, the doctor, and the missionaries, all indefatigable in 
their noble tasks.&nbsp; It was a different place when Damien 
came there and made this great renunciation, and slept that first
night under a tree amidst his rotting brethren: alone with 
pestilence; and looking forward (with what courage, with what 
pitiful sinkings of dread, God only knows) to a lifetime of 
dressing sores and stumps.</p>
<p>You will say, perhaps, I am too sensitive, that sights as 
painful abound in cancer hospitals and are confronted daily by 
doctors and nurses.&nbsp; I have long learned to admire and envy 
the doctors and the nurses.&nbsp; But there is no cancer hospital
so large and populous as Kalawao and Kalaupapa; and in such a 
matter every fresh case, like every inch of length in the pipe of
an organ, deepens the note of the impression; for what daunts the
onlooker is that monstrous sum of human suffering by which he 
stands surrounded.&nbsp; Lastly, no doctor or nurse is called 
upon to enter once for all the doors of that gehenna; they do not
say farewell, they need not abandon hope, on its sad threshold; 
they but go for a time to their high calling, and can look 
forward as they go to relief, to recreation, and to rest.&nbsp; 
But Damien shut-to with his own hand the doors of his own 
sepulchre.</p>
<p>I shall now extract three passages from my diary at 
Kalawao.</p>
<p><i>A</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Damien is dead and already somewhat 
ungratefully remembered in the field of his labours and 
sufferings.&nbsp; &lsquo;He was a good man, but very 
officious,&rsquo; says one.&nbsp; Another tells me he had fallen 
(as other priests so easily do) into something of the ways and 
habits of thought of a Kanaka; but he had the wit to recognise 
the fact, and the good sense to laugh at&rdquo; [over] 
&ldquo;it.&nbsp; A plain man it seems he was; I cannot find he 
was a popular.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>B</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;After Ragsdale&rsquo;s death&rdquo; 
[Ragsdale was a famous Luna, or overseer, of the unruly 
settlement] &ldquo;there followed a brief term of office by 
Father Damien which served only to publish the weakness of that 
noble man.&nbsp; He was rough in his ways, and he had no 
control.&nbsp; Authority was relaxed; Damien&rsquo;s life was 
threatened, and he was soon eager to resign.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>C</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of Damien I begin to have an 
idea.&nbsp; He seems to have been a man of the peasant class, 
certainly of the peasant type: shrewd, ignorant and bigoted, yet 
with an open mind, and capable of receiving and digesting a 
reproof if it were bluntly administered; superbly generous in the
least thing as well as in the greatest, and as ready to give his 
last shirt (although not without human grumbling) as he had been 
to sacrifice his life; essentially indiscreet and officious, 
which made him a troublesome colleague; domineering in all his 
ways, which made him incurably unpopular with the Kanakas, but 
yet destitute of real authority, so that his boys laughed at him 
and he must carry out his wishes by the means of bribes.&nbsp; He
learned to have a mania for doctoring; and set up the Kanakas 
against the remedies of his regular rivals: perhaps (if anything 
matter at all in the treatment of such a disease) the worst thing
that he did, and certainly the easiest.&nbsp; The best and worst 
of the man appear very plainly in his dealings with Mr. 
Chapman&rsquo;s money; he had originally laid it out&rdquo; 
[intended to lay it out] &ldquo;entirely for the benefit of 
Catholics, and even so not wisely; but after a long, plain talk, 
he admitted his error fully and revised the list.&nbsp; The sad 
state of the boys&rsquo; home is in part the result of his lack 
of control; in part, of his own slovenly ways and false ideas of 
hygiene.&nbsp; Brother officials used to call it 
&lsquo;Damien&rsquo;s Chinatown.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo;
they would say, &lsquo;your Chinatown keeps growing.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And he would laugh with perfect good-nature, and adhere to his 
errors with perfect obstinacy.&nbsp; So much I have gathered of 
truth about this plain, noble human brother and father of ours; 
his imperfections are the traits of his face, by which we know 
him for our fellow; his martyrdom and his example nothing can 
lessen or annul; and only a person here on the spot can properly 
appreciate their greatness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have set down these private passages, as you perceive, 
without correction; thanks to you, the public has them in their 
bluntness.&nbsp; They are almost a list of the man&rsquo;s 
faults, for it is rather these that I was seeking: with his 
virtues, with the heroic profile of his life, I and the world 
were already sufficiently acquainted.&nbsp; I was besides a 
little suspicious of Catholic testimony; in no ill sense, but 
merely because Damien&rsquo;s admirers and disciples were the 
least likely to be critical.&nbsp; I know you will be more 
suspicious still; and the facts set down above were one and all 
collected from the lips of Protestants who had opposed the father
in his life.&nbsp; Yet I am strangely deceived, or they build up 
the image of a man, with all his weakness, essentially heroic, 
and alive with rugged honesty, generosity, and mirth.</p>
<p>Take it for what it is, rough private jottings of the worst 
sides of Damien&rsquo;s character, collected from the lips of 
those who had laboured with and (in your own phrase) &ldquo;knew 
the man&rdquo;;&mdash;though I question whether Damien would have
said that he knew you.&nbsp; Take it, and observe with wonder how
well you were served by your gossips, how ill by your 
intelligence and sympathy; in how many points of fact we are at 
one, and how widely our appreciations vary.&nbsp; There is 
something wrong here; either with you or me.&nbsp; It is 
possible, for instance, that you, who seem to have so many ears 
in Kalawao, had heard of the affair of Mr. Chapman&rsquo;s money,
and were singly struck by Damien&rsquo;s intended 
wrong-doing.&nbsp; I was struck with that also, and set it fairly
down; but I was struck much more by the fact that he had the 
honesty of mind to be convinced.&nbsp; I may here tell you that 
it was a long business; that one of his colleagues sat with him 
late into the night, multiplying arguments and accusations; that 
the father listened as usual with &ldquo;perfect good-nature and 
perfect obstinacy&rdquo;; but at the last, when he was 
persuaded&mdash;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am very much
obliged to you; you have done me a service; it would have been a 
theft.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are many (not Catholics merely) who 
require their heroes and saints to be infallible; to these the 
story will be painful; not to the true lovers, patrons, and 
servants of mankind.</p>
<p>And I take it, this is a type of our division; that you are 
one of those who have an eye for faults and failures; that you 
take a pleasure to find and publish them; and that, having found 
them, you make haste to forget the overvailing virtues and the 
real success which had alone introduced them to your 
knowledge.&nbsp; It is a dangerous frame of mind.&nbsp; That you 
may understand how dangerous, and into what a situation it has 
already brought you, we will (if you please) go hand-in-hand 
through the different phrases of your letter, and candidly 
examine each from the point of view of its truth, its 
appositeness, and its charity.</p>
<blockquote><p>Damien was <i>coarse</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is very possible.&nbsp; You make us sorry for the lepers, 
who had only a coarse old peasant for their friend and 
father.&nbsp; But you, who were so refined, why were you not 
there, to cheer them with the lights of culture?&nbsp; Or may I 
remind you that we have some reason to doubt if John the Baptist 
were genteel; and in the case of Peter, on whose career your 
doubtless dwell approvingly in the pulpit, no doubt at all he was
a &ldquo;coarse, headstrong&rdquo; fisherman!&nbsp; Yet even in 
our Protestant Bibles Peter is called Saint.</p>
<blockquote><p>Damien was <i>dirty</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was.&nbsp; Think of the poor lepers annoyed with this dirty
comrade!&nbsp; But the clean Dr. Hyde was at his food in a fine 
house.</p>
<blockquote><p>Damien was <i>headstrong</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe you are right again; and I thank God for his strong 
head and heart.</p>
<blockquote><p>Damien was <i>bigoted</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am not fond of bigots myself, because they are not fond of 
me.&nbsp; But what is meant by bigotry, that we should regard it 
as a blemish in a priest?&nbsp; Damien believed his own religion 
with the simplicity of a peasant or a child; as I would I could 
suppose that you do.&nbsp; For this, I wonder at him some way 
off; and had that been his only character, should have avoided 
him in life.&nbsp; But the point of interest in Damien, which has
caused him to be so much talked about and made him at last the 
subject of your pen and mine, was that, in him, his bigotry, his 
intense and narrow faith, wrought potently for good, and 
strengthened him to be one of the world&rsquo;s heroes and 
exemplars.</p>
<blockquote><p>Damien <i>was not sent to Molokai</i>, <i>but went
there without orders</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this a misreading? or do you really mean the words for 
blame?&nbsp; I have heard Christ, in the pulpits of our Church, 
held up for imitation on the ground that His sacrifice was 
voluntary.&nbsp; Does Dr. Hyde think otherwise?</p>
<blockquote><p>Damien <i>did not stay at the settlement</i>, 
<i>etc.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is true he was allowed many indulgences.&nbsp; Am I to 
understand that you blame the father for profiting by these, or 
the officers for granting them?&nbsp; In either case, it is a 
mighty Spartan standard to issue from the house on Beretania 
Street; and I am convinced you will find yourself with few 
supporters.</p>
<blockquote><p>Damien <i>had no hand in the reforms</i>, 
<i>etc.</i></p>

<p>I think even you will admit that I have already been frank in 
my description of the man I am defending; but before I take you 
up upon this head, I will be franker still, and tell you that 
perhaps nowhere in the world can a man taste a more pleasurable 
sense of contrast than when he passes from Damien&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;Chinatown&rdquo; at Kalawao to the beautiful Bishop-Home 
at Kalaupapa.&nbsp; At this point, in my desire to make all fair 
for you, I will break my rule and adduce Catholic 
testimony.&nbsp; Here is a passage from my diary about my visit 
to the Chinatown, from which you will see how it is (even now) 
regarded by its own officials: &ldquo;We went round all the 
dormitories, refectories, etc.&mdash;dark and dingy enough, with 
a superficial cleanliness, which he&rdquo; [Mr. Dutton, the 
lay-brother] &ldquo;did not seek to defend.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is 
almost decent,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;the sisters will make that 
all right when we get them here.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; And yet I 
gathered it was already better since Damien was dead, and far 
better than when he was there alone and had his own (not always 
excellent) way.&nbsp; I have now come far enough to meet you on a
common ground of fact; and I tell you that, to a mind not 
prejudiced by jealousy, all the reforms of the lazaretto, and 
even those which he most vigorously opposed, are properly the 
work of Damien.&nbsp; They are the evidence of his success; they 
are what his heroism provoked from the reluctant and the 
careless.&nbsp; Many were before him in the field; Mr. Meyer, for
instance, of whose faithful work we hear too little: there have 
been many since; and some had more worldly wisdom, though none 
had more devotion, than our saint.&nbsp; Before his day, even you
will confess, they had effected little.&nbsp; It was his part, by
one striking act of martyrdom, to direct all men&rsquo;s eyes on 
that distressful country.&nbsp; At a blow, and with the price of 
his life, he made the place illustrious and public.&nbsp; And 
that, if you will consider largely, was the one reform needful; 
pregnant of all that should succeed.&nbsp; It brought money; it 
brought (best individual addition of them all) the sisters; it 
brought supervision, for public opinion and public interest 
landed with the man at Kalawao.&nbsp; If ever any man brought 
reforms, and died to bring them, it was he.&nbsp; There is not a 
clean cup or towel in the Bishop-Home, but dirty Damien washed 
it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Damien <i>was not a pure man in his relations with
women</i>, <i>etc.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>How do you know that?&nbsp; Is this the nature of conversation
in that house on Beretania Street which the cabman envied, 
driving past?&mdash;racy details of the misconduct of the poor 
peasant priest, toiling under the cliffs of Molokai?</p>
<p>Many have visited the station before me; they seem not to have
heard the rumour.&nbsp; When I was there I heard many shocking 
tales, for my informants were men speaking with the plainness of 
the laity; and I heard plenty of complaints of Damien.&nbsp; Why 
was this never mentioned? and how came it to you in the 
retirement of your clerical parlour?</p>
<p>But I must not even seem to deceive you.&nbsp; This scandal, 
when I read it in your letter, was not new to me.&nbsp; I had 
heard it once before; and I must tell you how.&nbsp; There came 
to Samoa a man from Honolulu; he, in a public-house on the beach,
volunteered the statement that Damien had &ldquo;contracted the 
disease from having connection with the female lepers&rdquo;; and
I find a joy in telling you how the report was welcomed in a 
public-house.&nbsp; A man sprang to his feet; I am not at liberty
to give his name, but from what I heard I doubt if you would care
to have him to dinner in Beretania Street.&nbsp; &ldquo;You 
miserable little -------&rdquo; (here is a word I dare not print,
it would so shock your ears).&nbsp; &ldquo;You miserable little 
------,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;if the story were a thousand 
times true, can&rsquo;t you see you are a million times a lower 
----- for daring to repeat it?&rdquo;&nbsp; I wish it could be 
told of you that when the report reached you in your house, 
perhaps after family worship, you had found in your soul enough 
holy anger to receive it with the same expressions; ay, even with
that one which I dare not print; it would not need to have been 
blotted away, like Uncle Toby&rsquo;s oath, by the tears of the 
recording angel; it would have been counted to you for your 
brightest righteousness.&nbsp; But you have deliberately chosen 
the part of the man from Honolulu, and you have played it with 
improvements of your own.&nbsp; The man from 
Honolulu&mdash;miserable, leering creature&mdash;communicated the
tale to a rude knot of beach-combing drinkers in a public-house, 
where (I will so far agree with your temperance opinions) man is 
not always at his noblest; and the man from Honolulu had himself 
been drinking&mdash;drinking, we may charitably fancy, to 
excess.&nbsp; It was to your &ldquo;Dear Brother, the Reverend H.
B. Gage,&rdquo; that you chose to communicate the sickening 
story; and the blue ribbon which adorns your portly bosom forbids
me to allow you the extenuating plea that you were drunk when it 
was done.&nbsp; Your &ldquo;dear brother&rdquo;&mdash;a brother 
indeed&mdash;made haste to deliver up your letter (as a means of 
grace, perhaps) to the religious papers; where, after many 
months, I found and read and wondered at it; and whence I have 
now reproduced it for the wonder of others.&nbsp; And you and 
your dear brother have, by this cycle of operations, built up a 
contrast very edifying to examine in detail.&nbsp; The man whom 
you would not care to have to dinner, on the one side; on the 
other, the Reverend Dr. Hyde and the Reverend H. B. Gage: the 
Apia bar-room, the Honolulu manse.</p>
<p>But I fear you scarce appreciate how you appear to your 
fellow-men; and to bring it home to you, I will suppose your 
story to be true.&nbsp; I will suppose&mdash;and God forgive me 
for supposing it&mdash;that Damien faltered and stumbled in his 
narrow path of duty; I will suppose that, in the horror of his 
isolation, perhaps in the fever of incipient disease, he, who was
doing so much more than he had sworn, failed in the letter of his
priestly oath&mdash;he, who was so much a better man than either 
you or me, who did what we have never dreamed of daring&mdash;he 
too tasted of our common frailty.&nbsp; &ldquo;O, Iago, the pity 
of it!&rdquo;&nbsp; The least tender should be moved to tears; 
the most incredulous to prayer.&nbsp; And all that you could do 
was to pen your letter to the Reverend H. B. Gage!</p>
<p>Is it growing at all clear to you what a picture you have 
drawn of your own heart?&nbsp; I will try yet once again to make 
it clearer.&nbsp; You had a father: suppose this tale were about 
him, and some informant brought it to you, proof in hand: I am 
not making too high an estimate of your emotional nature when I 
suppose you would regret the circumstance? that you would feel 
the tale of frailty the more keenly since it shamed the author of
your days? and that the last thing you would do would be to 
publish it in the religious press?&nbsp; Well, the man who tried 
to do what Damien did, is my father, and the father of the man in
the Apia bar, and the father of all who love goodness; and he was
your father too, if God had given you grace to see it.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
